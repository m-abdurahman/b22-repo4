I just created empty Remote Repository from GitHub.com account by clicking on the plus icon on top right corner and new repository and give a name and click create 

And cloned this repository by clicking on Set up in Desktop and (optionally select the location) & click on Clone 

It cloned our remote repo to local so we can start working locally
